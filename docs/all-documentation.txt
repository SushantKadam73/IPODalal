**1.2. Derived Values & Formulas:**

*   **Price/Value of One Lot:**
    ```
    Lot Value = Share Price * Shares per Lot
    ```

*   **Shareholder Price:**
    ```
    Shareholder Price = Share Price - Shareholder Discount
    ```

*   **Employee Price:**
    ```
    Employee Price = Share Price - Employee Discount
    ```

*   **Capital/Principle Required:**
    ```
    Capital Required = ∑ (Lots Applied in Category * Applicable Share Price for Category)
    ```
    Where:
        *   Applicable Share Price for Retail, SHNI, BHNI = Share Price
        *   Applicable Share Price for Shareholder = Shareholder Price
        *   Applicable Share Price for Employee = Employee Price

*   **Interest Cost:**
    ```
    Interest Cost = Capital Required * (Interest Rate / 100) * (Loan Period / 365)
    ```

*   **Total Cost:**
    ```
    Total Cost = Capital Required + Interest Cost
    ```

*   **Expected Gain (Simplified Calculation based on GMP):**
    ```
    Expected Gain = ∑ ( (Lots Applied in Category / Subscription Rate of Category) * (GMP + Category Discount) )
    ```
    Where:
        *   Category Discount for Retail, SHNI, BHNI = 0
        *   Category Discount for Shareholder = Shareholder Discount
        *   Category Discount for Employee = Employee Discount
        *   If Subscription Rate for a category is 0, assume Probability of Allotment = 0 for simplified calculation in Phase 1. (This basically means the category is not present. this may happen only in shareholder and employee categoty. ).
        
*   **Breakeven Price (per share):**
    ```
    Breakeven Price = (Share Price * Shares per Lot + (Interest Cost for all IPOs / Total Shares Applied across all IPOs)) / Shares per Lot
    ```
    *(Note: This is a simplified breakeven calculation assuming interest cost is distributed across all applied shares. More refined allocation methods can be implemented).*

**1.3. Output Metrics:**

The Funding Calculator will output the following:

*   **For Each IPO:**
    *   Shares Applied (per category and total)
    *   Lots Applied (per category and total)

## 2. Allocation Optimizer Formulas (Work In Progress - Basic Functionality in Phase 1)

The Allocation Optimizer aims to suggest optimal IPO application strategies based on user inputs and IPO parameters.  Phase 1 will implement basic functionality. More advanced optimization strategies will be developed in later phases.

**2.1. Basic Functionality (Phase 1) - Prioritization based on User-Selected Criteria:**

In Phase 1, the Allocation Optimizer will primarily focus on allowing users to prioritize IPO applications based on:

*   **GMP (Grey Market Premium)**
*   **Subscription Rate**
*   **Available Capital**

Users will be able to rank these criteria in order of importance. The system will then suggest an allocation strategy based on these priorities.

**Example - Prioritization Logic (Illustrative):**

1.  **Rank IPOs by GMP (Highest to Lowest).**
2.  **Filter IPOs based on Subscription Rate (e.g., only consider IPOs with Subscription Rate < X).**
3.  **Allocate Capital based on remaining IPOs, starting with the highest GMP IPO, until Capital is exhausted.**

**More Advanced Features (Future Phases - Not detailed in this document):**

*   Optimization based on probabilistic allotment models.
*   Capital rotation strategies across multiple IPOs based on timelines.
*   Risk assessment and diversification considerations in allocation strategies.

Detailed formulas for advanced optimization and allocation strategies will be documented in future iterations of this document.

This document outlines the core formulas for the Funding Calculator and the basic framework for the Allocation Optimizer in Phase 1. As the project evolves, these formulas and functionalities will be refined and expanded.

## 2. Frontend Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** **React v19**
    *   **Purpose:** To build a dynamic, interactive, and component-based user interface. React's component architecture promotes reusability and maintainability, crucial for a feature-rich dashboard. React v19 ensures we are using the latest stable and performant version.
    *   **Language:** **JavaScript (JS)** - The primary language for React development.

*   **UI Library & Component Library:** **Shadcn UI**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a set of pre-designed, aesthetically pleasing, and accessible UI components. Shadcn UI, built on Tailwind CSS and Radix UI, aligns perfectly with the minimalistic and modern aesthetic goal. It offers excellent customization and utility-first styling via Tailwind CSS, enhancing development speed and design consistency.
    *   **Rationale for Choosing Shadcn UI over Material-UI:** While Material-UI is a robust component library, Shadcn UI's unstyled nature and direct component integration offer greater flexibility for achieving a truly minimalistic and customized aesthetic. Focusing on Shadcn UI will streamline development and avoid potential style conflicts between multiple component libraries.

*   **Styling Utility:** **Tailwind CSS (Integrated with Shadcn UI)**
    *   **Purpose:** For utility-first CSS styling, enabling rapid and consistent styling by applying utility classes directly in the component markup. Tailwind CSS is fundamental to customizing Shadcn UI components and achieving the desired visual theme.

*   **State Management:** **Zustand**
    *   **Purpose:** For simple and scalable state management within the React application. Zustand is a minimalistic and unopinionated state management library well-suited for React, offering ease of use and good performance.

*   **Charting Library:** **Recharts**
    *   **Purpose:** To render interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs for displaying IPO data (e.g., GMP trends, subscription rates). Recharts is a React-based composable charting library that is lightweight and highly customizable, fitting the aesthetic and performance requirements.

## 3. Backend Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** **Express.js**
    *   **Purpose:** To build the backend API for the IPO Dalal project. Express.js is a lightweight and flexible Node.js framework, ideal for creating RESTful APIs to serve data to the React frontend.
    *   **Language:** **JavaScript (JS)** - Backend logic will be written in JavaScript, aligning with the frontend language for potential full-stack JavaScript development and team familiarity.
    *   **PERN Stack Context:**  While the request mentions PERN stack, and PostgreSQL is chosen as the database,  Express.js is being used here instead of a purely "PostgREST" approach (which directly exposes PostgreSQL as a REST API). Express.js provides more flexibility for custom business logic, data processing, and potentially more complex API endpoints beyond simple database CRUD operations.

## 4. Deployment Platform

*   **Platform:** **Vercel**
    *   **Purpose:** For easy and efficient deployment of both the frontend React application and potentially the backend API (if Node.js backend is also deployed on Vercel). Vercel is known for its seamless integration with modern frontend frameworks like React and its excellent performance and global CDN.

This tech stack is specifically chosen to meet the aesthetic, performance, responsiveness, and functional requirements of the IPO Dalal project, providing a modern, efficient, and maintainable platform.

```markdown
# IPO Dalal Project Documentation: Database, API, and Scraper Tech Stack

**File Description:** This document outlines the technology stack chosen for the Database, API, and Scraper components of the IPO Dalal project, focusing on data management, access, and collection.

---

## 1. Database

*   **Database System:** **PostgreSQL**
    *   **Purpose:** To serve as the primary database for storing all IPO-related data, company information, and potentially user data in future phases. PostgreSQL is a robust, scalable, and open-source relational database system known for its reliability, data integrity, and advanced features.
    *   **Rationale:** PostgreSQL is chosen for its proven track record in production environments, strong SQL compliance, JSON support (useful for semi-structured data), and suitability for web applications. It is a core component of the PERN stack, aligning with the project's technology preferences.

*   **Managed Database Service (Optional):** **Supabase**
    *   **Purpose:** To potentially leverage Supabase as a managed PostgreSQL service. Supabase offers a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform built on top of PostgreSQL, providing features like:
        *   Managed PostgreSQL database hosting.
        *   Realtime database capabilities.
        *   Authentication and authorization.
        *   Auto-generated APIs.
    *   **Consideration:** Supabase can simplify database setup, management, and backend development.  While PostgREST is mentioned for API, Supabase provides a broader set of backend functionalities. The project can choose to use Supabase directly for database hosting and backend services, or use a self-hosted PostgreSQL and potentially PostgREST/Express.js for API layers depending on project complexity and desired control.

## 2. API (Application Programming Interface)

*   **API Layer (Option 1 - Simplified):** **PostgREST**
    *   **Purpose:** To automatically create a RESTful API directly from the PostgreSQL database schema. PostgREST dynamically generates a complete REST API based on the database tables and relationships, minimizing backend coding for basic CRUD operations.
    *   **Rationale:** PostgREST offers a very rapid way to expose the database data as an API, reducing development time for basic data access. It aligns well with PostgreSQL and can be highly performant for data-centric APIs.

*   **API Layer (Option 2 - Flexible):** **Express.js (as documented in UI/Frontend/Backend Tech Stack)**
    *   **Purpose:** To build a more customized and flexible API using Express.js (Node.js). Express.js allows for implementing complex business logic, data transformations, custom endpoints, and more sophisticated API functionalities beyond what PostgREST directly provides.
    *   **Rationale:** If the project requires more than basic CRUD operations or needs custom API logic, Express.js offers the necessary flexibility. It can also integrate with PostgreSQL using Node.js PostgreSQL libraries.

*   **API Choice Decision:** The choice between PostgREST and Express.js for the API layer depends on the project's complexity. For Phase 1, if the API primarily needs to serve database data with minimal custom logic, PostgREST could be a faster and simpler option. If more complex API logic or backend processing is required, Express.js provides greater control and flexibility.

## 3. Scraper

*   **Language:** **Python**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop web scrapers for collecting IPO data from various online sources. Python is chosen for its rich ecosystem of web scraping libraries and ease of use.

*   **HTML Parsing Library:** **Beautiful Soup (Python)**
    *   **Purpose:** To efficiently parse HTML content extracted from web pages. Beautiful Soup simplifies navigating and searching the HTML structure to extract relevant IPO data points. It is well-suited for parsing relatively static HTML content.

*   **Browser Automation & JS Heavy Scraping Library:** **Playwright (Python)**
    *   **Purpose:** To handle scraping of dynamic websites that heavily rely on JavaScript to load content. Playwright allows for browser automation, enabling the scraper to interact with web pages, execute JavaScript, and scrape data that is rendered client-side. This is crucial for scraping modern websites and potentially for handling interactions on sites like NSE India.

*   **Data Storage:** **Supabase (PostgreSQL) - via Python Supabase Library**
    *   **Purpose:** Scraped data, after being parsed and cleaned in Python, will be stored in the PostgreSQL database (potentially hosted on Supabase). The Python Supabase library will be used to connect to the Supabase database and insert the scraped IPO data.

This tech stack for Database, API, and Scraper is designed to be robust, efficient, and scalable for collecting, managing, and providing access to IPO data for the IPO Dalal project.
